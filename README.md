## Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught developer focused on Rust, AI, and systems programming. I work on building robust systems and AI applications with a strong foundation in Rust. I'm experienced in systems programming, web development, and contributing to open-source projects.

## What I do

- **Rust & Systems Programming**: Building efficient, low-level systems and performance-critical applications
- **AI & ML**: Working with AI systems and exploring new approaches to AI development
- **Web Development**: Full-stack web development with modern tools and frameworks

## Currently

Contributing to [Symposium](https://symposium.dev) — an "AI the Rust Way" project exploring practical applications of AI with Rust.

## Let's connect

I'm available for hire and open to interesting opportunities in Rust, systems programming, AI, or web development. If you think we could work together, reach out!
